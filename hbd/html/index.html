                                        Hello! I'm Daz. It's been a while since I wrote a letter.
                                        It's been quite a while since your birthday, but I think this site I created for
                                        your birthday is meaningful to me, so I'm going to put it in my portfolio.
                                        It's been a while since I took it out and fixed it.
                                        I updated it to a new version while fixing it.
                                        And I've made a mobile version. Do you want to access the link?
                                        This time, I tried to make it look good regardless of the resolution of the
                                        monitor!
                                        Try using the computer instead of the mobile phone!
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="line"></div>
                                <div class="let_r">
                                    <p class="let_20">
                                        I'm going to send this letter in English for the consistency of the site, but
                                        English might be a little awkward because I'm going to use a translator.
                                        I'm thinking of writing in Japanese and translating it into English. I've heard
                                        that the quality of the translation will be better.
                                        I wish I could give you something nicer next year.
                                        Thank you for always supporting me.I'll work harder as much as you cheered for
                                        me! Thank you!
                                        It's past your birthday, so I wrote a short letter instead of a celebration.
                                        Have a nice day!
                                    </p>
